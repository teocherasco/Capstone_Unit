This project is connected to the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, being the capstone of the certification. The problem solved in this project is the necessity to predict whether the First Stage of the Falcon 9 Space X rocket will have a successful landing or not. Knowing that, if the landing is successful, the first stage of the rocket can be reusable (saving up to 15 million dollars).
